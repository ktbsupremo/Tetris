# Tetris implemented in Java
This was an assignment for my <a href="orb.essex.ac.uk/ce/ce203">Application Programming</a> module in my year 2 undegraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Essex, waiting for my mark.</br>
I was tasked with recreating the game Tetris in Java, using object oriented programming where possible, the game can be controlled with either the keyboard or mouse and has all the normal functionality including the ability to pause the game. When a line is made, the score will increment by 10 points.
